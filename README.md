**Goals**

- Using Chicago Police Department crime data from 2001 to present, summarize and examine crime statistics.

- Build and train Classification models to predict index offenses (more serious crimes).
- Compare performance of various classification techniques including logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines.
- Apply regularization and cross-validation techniques for model evaluation, selection, and optimization.
