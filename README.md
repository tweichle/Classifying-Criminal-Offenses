# Classifying-Criminal-Offenses
### Classification Application in Python Using scikit-learn and TensorFlow-Keras
(PySpark program included to show data exploration/manipulation and descriptive statistics analyses) 

This repository contains the prediction of more serious crimes using Chicago crime data accessed via Google BigQuery Storage API.

**Goals**

- Using Chicago Police Department crime data from 2001 to present, summarize and examine crime statistics.

- Build and train Classification models to predict index offenses (more serious crimes) implementing the following approaches:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forests Classification
  - Support Vector Machines Classification
  - XGBoost Classification
  - Neural Networks Classification
- Apply regularization and cross-validation techniques for model evaluation, selection, and optimization.
